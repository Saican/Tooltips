Tooltips v0.3.x.x - An Over-Engineered Solution to a Problem No One Has

Tooltips is a resource mod for (G)ZDoom versions that support ZScript version 4.2.1 and higher.
This mod creates new menu and menu item classes which support the display of tooltips to give
details and further explain the purpose or function of a menu item.  Tooltips takes this a step
further and offers extensive customization options to the end user, which when combined with
(G)ZDoom's localization capabilities, also offers significant increases in accessibility.
